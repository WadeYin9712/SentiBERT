Good to see India indignant about Amarnath Yatra. Do also try and visit the area around it too. There may be some more graves to weep for.
@PinkNews An outrage
I know black people say it. But that has nothing to do with white people. It doesn't offend some black people when JayZ says it 👐
I'm also wheezing really hard. I decided to make up today, and then after I got to work realized it was mbbsd, and now I'm #intimidated
i leave in 3 days and just now remembered that my car has massaging seats :/ #crap

@KidSkys Why did you rage quit FeelsBadMan, saw it in @KingGeorgeTV stream
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Trump is now fuming. He feels the whole game may now be blown because of Jr's stupidity.
To go back in time to the 1st grade so you can walk up and shove your bully on the playground. Little asshole.\n#StupidReasonsToUseTimeTravel
I thought he cried over some of his relative death or something but when i know the truth . I just wanna burst out 😂
@serotojin theyre literally trying to find as many ways as possible to offend or annoy every other person in the world

Catching up on Greys, almost couldn't make it through two episodes because of how sad the storyline was. Two best/worst eps for me.

James to Bayern is probably the smartest choice for him.\n\nAnd, frankly, this kind of scares me 😲
i want to ruffle jungkook's hair.... this is so sad
'How We Are Ruining America' By this liberal lip service pointing out an inequity that they protect while feigning indignation for all.
