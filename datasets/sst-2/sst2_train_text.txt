this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .
the movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but .

loosely speaking , we 're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin .
like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .
a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .
slightly disappointed .

dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and .
incorporates so much .
already-shallow .
we also need movies like tim mccann 's revolution no 9 .
as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .
it 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .

of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .
of spectacular belly flops .

by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it .
on its way .
there 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance .
beautiful , entertaining two hours .
the edge of your seat , tense with suspense .
it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome .
views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point .
a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .

is horrible .
the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor .
increasingly disturbed .
is less about a superficial midlife crisis .
something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .
a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .

stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere .
every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel .

to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
lame kiddie flick .
fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation well .
there is enough originality in ` life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens .

as much fun .
very real and amusing give-and-take .
makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 18 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .
kinda dumb .
for touched by an angel simplicity .
the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .
its engaging simplicity .
is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply .
, worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
the movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor .
sabotaged by pomposity .

enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch .
undeniably touched .
racial insensitivity .
only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department .

sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
surprisingly ` solid ' .
clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment .
an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you .
we 're touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport .
has succeeded beyond all expectation .
of a really solid woody allen film .
is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
both a grand tour through 300 hundred years of russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement .
