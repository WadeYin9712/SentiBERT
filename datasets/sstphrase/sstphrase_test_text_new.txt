The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
What you get with Empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .
Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .
Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .
With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .
So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
Though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal Woody at best .
Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
Sadly , Hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
Or a profit .
Or some damn thing .
The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
I like Frank the Pug , though .
A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .
Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
Moot point .
A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
Madonna still ca n't act a lick .
Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .
Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .
Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .
... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .
I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
Even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .
The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .
Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .

When she speaks , her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .

We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
Much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -LRB- the movie 's -RRB- mindset .
Well before it 's over , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .
Besides , real movie producers are n't this nice .
-LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .
Passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes .
For me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .
Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
Truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .

The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
Feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
It would have benefitted the dialogue .
A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
It 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .
It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
You 've seen them a million times .
Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
This one does .
The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
A soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .
An ungainly , comedy-deficient , B-movie rush job ...
A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .
Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
Boring we did n't .
Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to Barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
The film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
A baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -LRB- Woody Allen -RRB- has made in the last twenty years .
It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .
If I Spy were funny -LRB- enough -RRB- or exciting -LRB- enough -RRB- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
A very average science fiction film .
Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .

A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary Derrida .
Or , you can do something fun tonight .
Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
As with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .
What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
While Benigni -LRB- who stars and co-wrote -RRB- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?
Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
... has virtually no script at all ...
Will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick -LRB- remember Cabin Boy ? -RRB-
just pound away .
At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice 's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
Most of the action setups are incoherent .
Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .
The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
Sorry , Charlie
A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
And in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy .
The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .
All ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .
Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .
-LRB- Two -RRB- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
The film is really not so much bad as bland .
The central story lacks punch .
Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .
Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .
A harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
`` Men in Black II , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel .

This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .
While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
Apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton and Wahlberg could turn an Imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable TV .
A well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .

Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
I loved looking at this movie .
I just did n't care as much for the story .
Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .
It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
A gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .
It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .
Maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this .
A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller .
The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .

National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .

It settles for being merely grim .
The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
Just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
Just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -LRB- or during -RRB- consumption of its second half .
Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it .
The New Guy is one of them .
This is n't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
Everything that 's worthwhile about Collision Course can already be seen on television .
If this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .
Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .
All in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .
Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .
Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
The film 's center will not hold .
Myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
A great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and Crazy as Hell does n't even have a great ending .
Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .
A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .
I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
Nothing about it fits .

Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
I tried to read the time on my watch .
The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .

There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .

Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .
The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
Just a bloody mess .
Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .
Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
Bears is bad .
Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad .

A reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided .
The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
The Marquis de Sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .

A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -LRB- k -RRB- statement .
The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
And forget about any attempt at a plot !
It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo 's cool jackets .
