@chertex @TheRoyalsOnE that's awesome you met @justinhartley . I really enjoy the show #ThisIsUs
I think @MiloVentimiglia's character on #ThisIsUs is probably one of the best dads ever on a tv show.
@ChrissyMetz you are so beautiful and an inspiration. #ThisIsUs is my husband's and my favorite show.
We must catch the moments while we're young and quick, for soon we will be old and slow. #ThisIsUs

@Channel4 whoever is narrating the trailer for #thisisus should be sacked!  Silly c*w thinks saying 'thizizuz' is perhaps alluring! Wrong!!
@MatthewGilbert @BostonGlobe Link to review for #ThisIsUs isn't launching.
@AndiNeglia she's not half as bad as the stupid cow currently narrating the trailer for #thisisus - just hear her ridiculous take #thizizuz
Good for Kate for recognizing that she needs to be happy with herself to be happy with Toby. #ThisIsUs

@megynkelly I think you forgot to follow your own advice. IMO. @petestavros
@AlwaysInAmerica @CamilleRenee8 @megynkelly what does that have to do with PC? + she's only promoting her book. was a victim too.
@brsquared @megynkelly I'd disagree with you Bruce. Read her book. I'd be happy to gift it to you, if you are willing to read it.
@kimberlyconroy @petestavros @megynkelly no hate in my heart! I don't like fake people hypocrites who point there finger at others to gain $
Love @dagenmcdowell ! We need to see more of her on @FoxNews . Maybe replace @megynkelly ?
@sam_ponder @megynkelly loooooooooool yea if you're willing to fuck Roger Ailes for a job @FreddiePhysical
@petestavros @megynkelly ....then don't just simply brand everyone and anyone who disagrees with you as a "hater" in a generalization !
@moosehickey @kimberlyconroy @megynkelly not sure where you are getting that from. Oh and your last tweet is hateful/disrespectful
@petestavros @megynkelly maybe bc 2 big headed 2 snarky 2 childish 2 animated 2 sarcastic 2 many hand gestures 2 anti Trump  is that enough?
@eieioink @megynkelly when did I do that? The minute I tweeted that, everyone replying to my tweet was being hateful.
@petestavros @megynkelly she said she was a hostage to big bad Trump for over a year. Wtf, PC would be not calling her on her crap
@megynkelly @ainsleyearhardt You should take over her show permanently.
@JiIIybeann @megynkelly  Nice, and i'm with you on that!
Pretty inspiring to see where people came from and how it shaped who they are today. Really enjoying your book so far @megynkelly
@Jmmaly1 @megynkelly not sure where you get all of that from. And even of some of those were true, that makes it okay to send hateful tweets
@petestavros @megynkelly we all have "personal life's" with a story to tell! I dislike her fake emotions & attitude https://t.co/eXR2zGLkDK
@AlwaysInAmerica @megynkelly I'm sure Trump's actions & words did make her life a living hell for a while. Can't blame her.

@JohnRebuttal @petestavros @megynkelly Learning from those who cause massive attention can be useful if you wanna do it too, or prevent it.
@megynkelly is there a special way you could sign my Kindle version of your book? It's the one downfall of the e-book empire

Are you against animal testing? Be sure to stay up to date... https://t.co/kFdkzkn2ci
Animal testing should not be a thing
Instead of being fully against animal testing, we must understand that it's essential to furthering medical advances for people and animals.
I'm doing a speech on animal testing and it is so fucking horrible oh my god
@rachelmealey @YouTube perfect365 app does live makeup pics ‚ò∫ shiseido still animal testing üòê
@sufferxeternal I feel this so hard I did a photo project on animal testing and she said it was gross and didn't wanna look at it
@jamescharles just because you use products that are not vegan doesn't mean you support animal testing
@jamescharles @motelamour ummm literally so many brands have stopped animal testing #doyourresearch
@jamescharles @motelamour um u don't have to be vegan to be against animal testing but k
Leave @jamescharles he doesn't do animal testing the company does. Some face wash company's DO animal testing and I don't see u no buying it
@jamescharles It's not okay to ignore animal testing just because it's your opinion that it doesn't matter.
@jamescharles ur money goes to animal testing Get Over It and buy other things
Not being vegan and not caring about animal testing are two WAY different things. The latter is just straight up sh‚Ä¶ https://t.co/NG5Wtk65cx
Sorry but there is absolutely no excuse to support or ignore the concept of animal testing, its cruel and disgusting and needs to be stopped
Animal testing is the sadest thing I have ever had to research and I've actually broken into tears while writing this paper.
@jamescharles I'm sorryüòïIt's not their business-what kind of people are they to wish these things on you that are worse than animal testing
Examples of injuries sustained during animal testing?! Anybody?!
For no reason because animal testing doesn't translate to humans anyway
@pussy_galore_ anyways u can assume I & others have the best intentions & wouldnt advocate nonconsentual testing for anyone, human or animal
Many large scale companies (such as MAC) that are listed as non CF dont do any animal testing in countries where it's not mandated by law
@SineadStubbins MAC is perfect, but no longer animal-testing free üòøI'm on a constant search for a Lady Danger dupe that feels as good...
MAC does not do any animal testing in the United States (minus the few products with SPF) however CoverGirl and many others test everything

@TylerPopcott @PrincessSagan like.. you're making your line cf so everyone can buy it but not because animal testing is cruel & torture? Ok
@im_sucha_lopez but he's trash. The full on rant he did where he said animal testing "is okay." And an "opinion," proved that to me.
by putting it on your face, you're condoning animal testing and animal ingredients in make up!!

Some NBA team is going to waste a 1st round pick on Grayson Allen. I'm guessing the Suns
Grayson Allen been trash this season so far hurt but still
Even with Grayson Allen's complete inability to make shots right now he still draws all the attention of the defense
grayson allen is a dawg
A Grayson Allen 3 gives him 10 and puts Duke up 12.  He's bumped and to the line.  Hits both, has 12, Duke up 14
is there anyone worse than Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen is good. I think he can pay next level. 2nd round.
We need to start talking more about how Grayson Allen can play point guard in the NBA. Such a terrific and willing passer
I never thought I would say this but Grayson Allen is very close to surpassing JJ Redick as my favorite Blue Devil of all time.
Grayson Allen with five points and a really nice assist over the final 2:40 and Duke leads William & Mary 46-30 at the half.
Cameron Crazie in Duke's halftime contest wearing a No. 3 Duke jersey with "ALLEN" on the back. Hope Grayson's making something off that.
12, 4 and 3 to Grayson Allen at the half. Still not 100% but that‚Äôs a decent first half.
Grayson Allen only plays well against bad teams
Grayson Allen & Luke Kennard carry this team, But more importantly, they carry eachother. They are the keys to this team.
Grayson Allen just gave dude such a sick move
Duke runs rare set with Grayson designed to curl around screen and get ball from Amile at left elbow. Allen's fouled. 55-41 under-16 TO
Grayson Allen murdered dozens of people in northern California in the late 1960s and early 1970s
Grayson Allen could sneeze and someone would get charged with a foul for giving him a cold
@joey_judge he is ... Grayson allen is just better

Grayson Allen should have gone to the #NBA after last season. His stock wont ever b that high again and that's not a shot at him as a player

@NelsonForTruth I found that for Medicaid, the largest welfare program for poor Americans only had a fraud rate of 9.8%-- NOT a majority
@WalshFreedom You've celebrated people that commit Medicaid fraud.

@GerryDuggan I work in Medicaid benefit determination and it blows my mind that some of my clients may have voted for Trump.
@NelsonForTruth But what happens where there are no more jobs to have? Also, like I said, the majority of ppl on Medicaid DO have jobs
people didn't necessarily become "less sick" by having Medicaid... but there's a lot to unpack there & access to cost shielding is 1st step
Anyway the way OR rolled out its OHP access in '08 is a good antecedent to Medicaid expansion in the ACA
